# Python Fundamentals - Classes, Functions, and File Handling


## Overview

This repository contains a series of Python projects and code demonstrations that cover essential programming concepts such as modules, file handling, classes and objects, and the use of global and local variables. These topics are fundamental for any beginner or intermediate Python developer aiming to strengthen their understanding of object-oriented programming and practical file management within Python.

## Key Features

* Modules: Understanding and using Python modules to structure code efficiently.
* File Handling: Reading, writing, and managing files in Python, including working with various file modes and handling exceptions.
* Classes and Objects: Implementing object-oriented programming in Python, including class methods, attributes, and object instantiation.
* Global & Local Variables: Distinguishing between global and local variable scopes and understanding how to manipulate them effectively.

## Technology Used

* Programming Language: Python 3.x
* Libraries:
  * os for file handling and directory management.
  * sys for system-related operations
  * Standard Python modules for basic class and function   implementations
